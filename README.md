# Parkinson's Disease Detection and Staging

A machine learning-based Streamlit web application that detects Parkinson's Disease and predicts its stage using a trained model.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes a KNN classifier, Decision Tree Model, and Support Vector Machine three machine learning models - trained on biomedical data measurements to detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in patients and identify its progression stage.

Key functionalities:

- Upload patient input features
- Predict disease presence
- Indicate disease severity or stage
- Easy-to-use web interface powered by Streamlit
